-- CREATING A SUBTHEME --

First and foremost, copy this directory (/profiles/openchurch/themes/openchurch_theme_starter) to your themes directory (/sites/all/themes) and rename it to a new theme name. This prevents your subtheme from being overwritten when OpenChurch (or OpenChurch Theme) is updated.
